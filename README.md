# TODO

- Create middleware for file checking
- Rewrite error sent by the server
- Good express practice
- Put configuration in another file
- Create a dependency injection service that create all services from the configuration
- Write route in a way that they can be tested in a unit test instead of integration test
- Rewrite error system. Each error appening in routes need to be threw and the error middleware need to handle them.
